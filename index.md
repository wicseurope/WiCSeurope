# WiCS Europe (WiCS‑E+)

**Women in Cognitive Science (WiCS)** serves as an umbrella organization dedicated to advancing equity, visibility, and inclusion for women—cisgender, transgender, and gender‑diverse individuals—in cognitive science.

Founded in **2001** by **Drs. Judith Kroll, Randi Martin, and Suparna Rajaram**, WiCS has been committed to celebrating the contributions of women, addressing systemic barriers, and fostering professional development opportunities. In **2021**, WiCS expanded its mission to **WiCS+**, signaling a broader commitment to inclusivity for all historically underrepresented groups in cognitive science. This includes promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion across intersecting identities such as race, ethnicity, gender, ability, and socioeconomic background.

Through mentorship, advocacy, and community‑building, WiCS+ empowers a global network of scholars and works toward a more inclusive and equitable field of cognitive science. Central to WiCS+ is the creation of **safe, inclusive spaces free of violence, discrimination, and harassment**, grounded in mutual respect, dignity, and human rights.

## WiCS Europe

The **European chapter of WiCS (WiCS‑E)** was established in **2016** at the International Psychonomics Meeting in **Granada, Spain**, co‑founded by **Drs. Teresa Bajo and Cristina Cacciari**. WiCS‑E+ focuses on amplifying the visibility of women and other underrepresented communities in Europe, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities, and strengthening the global cognitive science community through shared values of inclusion and respect.

## Mission

WiCS‑E+ connects cognitive scientists across Europe and creates opportunities to share ideas, collaborate, and support career development.

You will find us at:

* Biannual **ESCoP** meetings
* Other cognitive science conferences such as **ICPS, ISB, and SARMAC**
* Online events held at least once a year, with a recurring event every **March** to celebrate **Women’s Month**

Our goals are to:

* Provide resources for professional and research career development
* Foster collaboration and mentoring opportunities
* Create spaces for meaningful connections and open knowledge sharing
* Promote equity, inclusion, and visibility for scholars historically excluded from science

Through mentoring, shared resources, and collective care, we strive to make cognitive science a field where **every voice matters**.

## Our Commitments

We are committed to:

* Celebrating the contributions of women and gender‑diverse scholars
* Promoting **intersectional inclusion**
* Providing meaningful support and visibility for scholars historically excluded from academia
* Creating communities rooted in mentorship, intergenerational dialogue, and collective care
* Centering **queer, trans, and non‑binary voices** as essential to the future of science

## Advancing Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion: A Collective Responsibility

### Acknowledge Structural Inequities

Many scholars—especially early‑career researchers and those from the Global South—face:

* Geopolitical and visa barriers
* Economic precarity
* Health‑related, disability, and caregiving constraints

### Ensure Equitable Representation

* Representation must be **authentic and consequential**, not symbolic
* Center historically excluded voices, languages, and perspectives
* Foster intergenerational, intersectional, and multilingual dialogue

### Reimagine Participation Models

* Hybrid formats must be fully participatory—not second‑tier
* Sliding‑scale fees and solidarity funds should be the norm
* Travel grants, childcare/caretaking support, and inclusive technology must be built in, not optional

### Build a Culture of Solidarity

* Inclusion is not an invitation—it is a transformation
* Equity is about **justice, integrity, and sustainability**, not generosity
* Academic spaces must reflect the full diversity of human experience by design
