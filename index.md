WiCS Europe + 
Women in Cognitive Science (WiCS) serves as an umbrella organization dedicated to advancing equity, visibility, and inclusion for women–cisgender, transgender, and gender-diverse individuals– in cognitive science. Since its founding in 2001 by Drs. Judith Kroll, Randi Martin, and Suparna Rajaram, WiCS has been committed to celebrating the contributions of women, addressing systemic barriers, and fostering professional development opportunities. In 2021, WiCS expanded its mission to become WiCS+, signaling a broader commitment to inclusivity for all historically underrepresented groups in cognitive science. This includes promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion across intersecting identities such as race, ethnicity, gender, ability and socioeconomic background. Through mentorship, advocacy, and community-building, WiCS+ continues to empower a global network of scholars, striving to make the field of cognitive science more inclusive and equitable. Central to WiCS+ is the creation of safe, inclusive spaces free of all forms of violence, discrimination, and harassment, where scholars can thrive in an environment built on mutual respect and dignity. WiCS+ further underscores the fundamental importance of human rights as the foundation for equity and inclusion, aiming to empower a global network of scholars and shape cognitive science into a more inclusive and equitable field where all voices and perspectives are fully represented and valued. As part of this mission, the European chapter of WiCS (WiCS-E) was established in 2016 at the International Psychonomics Meeting in Granada (Spain), co-founded by Drs. Teresa Bajo and Cristina Cacciari. WiCS+-E focuses on amplifying the visibility of women and other underrepresented communities in Europe, creating networking opportunities, and fostering collaboration, while strengthening the global network of cognitive scientists through shared values of inclusion and respect.

Mission
WiCS-E+ connects cognitive scientists across Europe and creates opportunities to share ideas, collaborate, and support career development. You’ll find us regularly at the biannual ESCoP meeting and at other scientific meetings in cognitive science such as ICPS, ISB, or SARMAC, as well as in online events at least once every year, with one fixed in March to celebrate Women’s Month.
Our main goal is to provide resources for professional research career development and foster collaboration. We work to create spaces where scholars can build meaningful connections, access mentoring opportunities, and share knowledge openly. Beyond networking, we aim to strengthen the academic community by promoting equity, inclusion, and visibility for those historically excluded from science. Through mentoring, shared resources, and collective care, we strive to make cognitive science a field where every voice matters.

We are committed to:
Celebrate the contributions of women and all gender-diverse scholars
Promote intersectional inclusion
Provide meaningful support and visibility for scholars historically excluded from academic spaces
Create communities rooted in mentorship, intergenerational dialogue, and collective care
Center queer, trans, and non-binary voices — not as exceptions, but as essential to the future of science
The Role of the Academic Community in Advancing EDI: A Collective Responsibility
1. Acknowledge Structural Inequities
• Many scholars — especially early-career and Global South researchers — face: Geopolitical and visa barriers, Economic precarity, Health-related, disability, and caregiving constraints
2. Ensure Equitable Representation: authentic and consequential, not symbolic.
• Center historically excluded voices, languages, and perspectives 
• Foster intergenerational, intersectional, and multilingual dialogue.
3. Reimagine Participation Models
• Make access tangible and equitable: Hybrid formats must be fully participatory, not second-tier
▸ Sliding-scale fees and solidarity funds should become norms, not exceptions: Travel grants, childcare/caretaking support, and inclusive tech must be built in, not optional
4. Build a Culture of Solidarity: Academic spaces must move from privilege to shared accountability.
• Inclusion is not an invitation — it’s a transformation of how we gather, share, and support one another.
• Putting EDI at the forefront is not about generosity — it is about justice, integrity, and sustainability.
• It is our collective responsibility to build academic spaces that reflect and support the full diversity of human experience — not by exception, but by design.
