# WiCS Europe (WiCS+E)

[**Women in Cognitive Science (WiCS)**](https://www.womenincogsci.org/) sis an umbrella organization dedicated to advancing equity, visibility, and inclusion for all scientists in cognitive science.

Founded in **2001** by **Drs. [Judith Kroll](https://bilingualismmindbrain.com/lab-members/judith-f-kroll/), Randi Martin, and[ Suparna Rajaram](https://rajarammemorylab.com/suparna-rajaram/)**, WiCS has  worked to celebrate the contributions of women, dismantle systemic barriers, and create professional development opportunities. 

Due to the historical underrepresentation of women in academia, WiCS emerged from the collective effort of female scientists who recognized the need to unite in order to enhance visibility and support career development throughout the academic journey. As such, the primary audience for WiCS events includes individuals who identify as women (cisgender, transgender, and gender‑diverse) in cognitive science. However, participation is not exclusive, as we aim to foster collaboration across the entire community and emphasize that all are welcome. In **2021**, WiCS broadened its mission to **WiCS+**, signaling a stronger commitment to inclusivity for all historically underrepresented groups in cognitive science. This expansion includes promoting **diversity, equity, and inclusion across intersecting identities such as race, ethnicity, gender, ability, and socioeconomic background**. WiCS is now a worldwide network with active chapters in [Canada](https://wicsc.ca/) and Europe, and it continues to grow - expanding its reach, building connections, and shaping a more inclusive future for cognitive science.

Through mentorship, advocacy, and community‑building, WiCS+ empowers a global network of scholars and works toward a more inclusive and equitable field of cognitive science. Central to WiCS+ is the creation of **safe, inclusive spaces free of violence, discrimination, and harassment**, grounded in mutual respect, dignity, and human rights.

## WiCS Europe

The **European chapter of WiCS (WiCS+E)** was established in **2016** at the International Psychonomics Meeting in **Granada, Spain**, co‑founded by **Drs. Teresa Bajo and Cristina Cacciari**. WiCS+E focuses on amplifying the visibility of women and other underrepresented communities in Europe, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities, and strengthening the global cognitive science community through shared values of inclusion and respect.
