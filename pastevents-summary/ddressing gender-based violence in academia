<h3>About the seminar</h3>

<p>
On the occasion of International Women’s Month, Women in Cognitive Science-Europe and Royal Holloway
University of London are hosting an online seminar dedicated to addressing gender-based violence
in academia.
</p>

<p>
We are honored to welcome <strong>Professor Anne Laure Humbert</strong> (University of Gothenburg) as our
guest speaker. Professor Humbert is an expert in gender equality metrics and structural change in
academia, and she will draw on her work in the EU-funded <em>uniSAFE</em> and <em>genderSAFE</em> projects.
</p>

<p>
The seminar aims to raise awareness and drive action by exploring the different forms of
gender-based violence in academic settings, the obstacles to reporting and addressing it, and
effective strategies for prevention. This event is designed for academics at all career stages
who are committed to fostering safer, more equitable, and more inclusive academic environments.
</p>

<p>
Are you committed to eradicating gender-based violence? Do you wonder whether gender-safe academic
environments are achievable? Are you curious about how to cultivate inclusive atmospheres in
science? Join us online and take part in this crucial conversation.
