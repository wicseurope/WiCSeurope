<h3>Panel discussion: Transitions in Career Paths</h3>

<p>
Career transition experiences of cognitive scientists can involve changes across institutions,
countries, roles, or work fields. These transitions shape not only academic careers but also
personal lives, posing challenges for both early career researchers and senior academics.
</p>

<p>
Women in Cognitive Science-Europe (WiCS-E) invited participants to reflect on the opportunities
and challenges of making career transitions both within and beyond academia. A diverse panel
of cognitive scientists from different countries and career stages shared personal experiences
and discussed how academic skills can be transferred to a range of professional contexts.
</p>

<p>
The panel presentations were followed by an open discussion with the audience and a speed
mentoring session.

<h3>Speed mentoring & reception</h3>

<p>
As part of the event, WiCS-Europe hosted a speed mentoring session aimed at connecting junior
researchers with senior faculty members. Participants met for focused conversations of up to
20 minutes, with the possibility of two mentor–mentee sessions depending on sign-ups. The
session included a coffee reception.
</p>

<p>
WiCS speed mentoring has previously taken place at major international meetings, including the
Psychonomic Society (US and Europe), APS, ICPS, and ESCOP.
