<h1>Highlights from WiCS+E March Event: Building Inclusive Computational Skills</h1>

<p>
This year, we hosted an inspiring <strong>Women in Cognitive Science – Widening Inclusivity in Cognitive Science (WiCS+E)</strong> March event, with over <strong>80 participants</strong> joining online to discuss gender gaps in coding and modeling, and how to address barriers to improve research methods and foster interdisciplinary careers.
</p>

<p>
The discussion brought together diverse perspectives on programming, inclusivity, and the future of computational skills in cognitive science.
</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

    <strong>Ana Paqui Palenciano</strong> (University of Granada)<br>
    <em>“Coding from (Neuro)Science & Reprogramming Stereotypes”</em>
  </li>

    <em>“Building Inclusive Computational Skills”</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Conversation Matters</h2>

<p>
We began by revisiting a persistent issue: women remain underrepresented in technical and computational roles, including coding and modeling in cognitive science. Importantly, performance differences do <strong>not</strong> explain this gap.
</p>

<p>
Research instead highlights factors such as confidence, self-efficacy, stereotypes, and the learning environment. Supportive teaching and mentorship have measurable effects on participation and persistence.
</p>

<p>
This is precisely why this event was organised: to discuss how education, community, and open practices can help close the gender gap and build more inclusive computational spaces.

<h2>💻 Do We Really Need to Learn How to Program?</h2>

<p><strong>Short answer: Yes.</strong></p>

<p>Programming increases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Control</li>
  <li>Flexibility</li>
  <li>Automaticity</li>
  <li>Precision</li>
  <li>Transparency</li>
  <li>Reproducibility in science</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, access to programming is not neutral. Stereotypes around “who a programmer is” (male, brilliant, socially awkward, white…) often collide with stereotypes about psychologists (empathetic, caregiving, “soft science”). These conflicting images shape confidence and self-perception long before actual performance does.
</p>

<p><strong>Strategies discussed to widen access:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Early exposure to programming</li>
  <li>Addressing the “elephant in the room”: explicitly teaching about gender gaps and stereotypes</li>
  <li>Diversifying role models</li>
  <li>Fighting structural barriers to real access</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Interdisciplinarity in Action</h2>

<p>
Drawing from their interdisciplinary research paths combining psychology and computer science, the speakers emphasized two key messages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t ask what Computer Science can do for you — ask what you can do for Computer Science.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive Science expertise is not secondary — it is essential for meaningful, theory-driven computational research.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>🤖 What About LLMs and AI?</h2>

<p>
During the Q&A, we addressed the growing role of large language models and AI in programming and research:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, use LLMs — but do not trust outputs blindly</li>
  <li>Avoid copy–paste learning when you are starting</li>
  <li>Learn the basics first, then integrate AI strategically</li>
  <li>
    Contribute to open science initiatives (e.g., 
    <a href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/">The Turing Way</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Contribute to the tools you use (e.g., 
    <a href="https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy">PsychoPy</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
One particularly important takeaway was the <strong>self-evaluation gap</strong>: many researchers underestimate their skills. The advice was clear — contribute anyway. Your code improves by being used, shared, and discussed.
