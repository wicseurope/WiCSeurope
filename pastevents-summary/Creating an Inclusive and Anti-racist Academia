<h3>About the event</h3>

<p>
Despite ongoing efforts to promote anti-racism and equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), academic
work often remains limited to Western perspectives, overlooking the richness and diversity of
global knowledge systems. This online panel discussion aims to address the persistent systemic
inequalities and barriers faced by people of colour in academia.
</p>

<p>
Held during the United Kingdom’s Black History Month, the event brings together scholars who will
share evidence-based insights and showcase ongoing initiatives designed to foster more inclusive
and anti-racist academic environments. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on these issues
and inspired to take action within their own institutional and disciplinary contexts.
</p>
