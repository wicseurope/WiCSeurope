<p><strong>Event:</strong> WiCS+Europe at ESCOP2025, Sheffield, United Kingdom</p>
<p><strong>Date & Time:</strong> Tuesday, 2 September 2025, 13:30–16:30 (BST)</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> ESCOP2025 Satellite Event</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Diamond Lecture Theatre 7</p>

<h2>Creating inclusive and safe academic spaces:</h2>
<h3>Celebrating 25 years of Women in Cognitive Science & looking ahead</h3>

<h3>Panel discussion | 13:30–15:00 (BST)</h3>

<p>
Women in Cognitive Science (WiCS) was founded in 2001 with the aim of supporting the professional
development of young scholars in cognitive science. The initiative emerged in response to the
historical underrepresentation of women in scientific environments, the need to reduce gender
stereotypes and biases, and the goal of increasing the visibility of both junior and senior women
scientists.
</p>

<p>
Over the past 25 years, significant progress has been made toward reducing gender inequalities.
However, many challenges remain, and recent global events remind us that social change is not
linear and cannot be taken for granted. This panel will reflect on the foundation and trajectory
of WiCS, drawing lessons from the past to inform future directions for Widening Inclusivity in
Cognitive Science (WiCS+).
</p>

<p>
The discussion will focus on fostering greater inclusivity, visibility, and professional growth
for everyone in academia. The panel will be followed by an open discussion with the audience.
All gender identities are welcome, and participants are encouraged to share reflections, lessons
learned, and ideas for navigating the changing academic landscape.

<h3>Speed mentoring & coffee break | 15:00–16:30 (BST)</h3>

<p>
The event concludes with a WiCS+Europe Speed Mentoring session, including a coffee reception.
This session offers junior researchers the opportunity to connect with senior faculty to discuss
research topics and academic career development. Participants will be matched with one or two
mentors for brief, focused conversations designed to be both meaningful and productive.
</p>

<p>
WiCS speed mentoring has been successfully held at major international conferences such as the
Psychonomic Society, SARMAC, APS, ICPS, and ESCOP. The session follows a few guiding principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a one-time mentoring session and does not imply a long-term commitment.</li>
  <li>Mentees should come prepared with one or two specific questions.</li>
  <li>Mentees may share their CV and questions in advance, without expectation of prior review.</li>
  <li>All information shared during the session is strictly confidential.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The speed mentoring session is open to scientists of all gender identities, and both mentors and
mentees from previous editions have consistently found it highly valuable.
