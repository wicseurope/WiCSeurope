<p>
  [Alicia Luque is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Language Studies at Nebrija University and Principal Investigator at the Nebrija Research Center in Cognition in Madrid, Spain. 
  Her research, supported by the César Nombela Talent Attraction Grant (2024–2029) from the General Directorate of Research and Technological Innovation 
  from the Regional Government of Madrid (Spain), bridges applied linguistics, cognitive neuroscience,
  and social psychology to explore how individual factors shape language learning trajectories and outcomes, particularly in migration contexts. 
  She also investigates how the process of becoming and being bi/multilingual influences linguistic, socio-affective, and neurocognitive functioning, 
  while critically examining whether research and practical applications accurately capture bi/multilingualism as an inherently diverse, dynamic, and multidimensional life experience. 
  Committed to advancing inclusive and ecologically valid research, she advocates for methodologies that reflect the complexity of 
  real-world language use and the intersectional identities of bi/multilingual communities.]
